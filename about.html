      <h3>About Me</h3>
      My name is Sunny Long, I am a programming student at Seneca College. This
      website is the final assessment of the course WEB222. Aeroplane Chess is
      my favourite board in my childhood. It is easy to learn. The colours made
      it suitable for children in elementary schools. Also, this game is more
      than just luck base, it requires some logical thinking and strategies. It
      is the perfect board game for children.
