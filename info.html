      <h3>History</h3>
      <p class="red">
        Aeroplane Chess is also called <em>Flying Chess</em> or
        <em>Fei Xing Qi</em> in Chinese. The board game is developed in the 20
        century. The chess pieces require going around the board clockwise to
        reach the goal. Maybe it is like the actual flight formation of the
        plane and led to the name of this game. <em>Ludo </em> game is a board
        game that is likely the predecessor of Aeroplane Chess.
        <em>Ludo </em> game also consists of 4 colours green, blue, red, and
        yellow, each colour also has 4 chess pieces, and the game is driven by
        dice too. As consequences result, the Aeroplane is invented from the
        <em>Ludo </em> game with the combination of plane elements. Aeroplane
        Chess is easy to learn, especially with the colour variations, and the
        plane elements, it is a popular game among Children. Aeroplane is to be
        found in homes, schools, and community centers. The game even has
        tournaments hosted in China.

          <em>hanger</em>, the beginning of the chess, 4 colours of track that
          have 52 spaces or grids, the goal zone leading to the center, and a
          dotted track for shortcuts.

      <h3>How to play the game?</h3>
      <p class="red">
        Aeroplane Chess requires a minimum of 2 players, but best to have 4
        players. In the beginning, each player will have 4 chess at their
        hanger, all players will decide the order of colour to roll the dice by
        rock, paper, scissor. Then the player will roll the dice, notice that
        only rolling a 6 by the dice can let their chess piece start, each chess
        requires a 6 to be rolled. The chess piece will move the same step
        according to the dice number rolled. The track has 4 colours, when the
        chess stop at the same colour as the space, the chess will jump 4 steps,
        which the next space of the same colour. The chess's goal is to go
        around in clockwise and head to the goal zone of its colour. In the goal
        zone, unless the dice roll the same number of steps toward the goal,
        otherwise the extra step will make a chess step back. Other than the
        jumping mechanism, there is also a shortcut for each colour, the dotted
        track, if the chess stops exactly at the point of the dotted track, this
        chess will follow the track and head across the goal zone of other
        colours, making itself much closer to the goal. When the player has all
        4 of his or her chess stopped at the designated goal zone, this player
        wins as first, other players may proceed to earn other places.
      </p>

      <h3>Rules:</h3>
      <ol class="yellow">
        <li>
          roll a 6 to let is chess load to the start location, there could be
          multiple chess stacks at the start location
        </li>
        <img src="./img/Start location.JPG" alt="Start Location" />
        <li>
          chess stopped as the same colours of itself will move 4 steps ahead,
          also called as jumping.
        </li>
        <li>
          additional roll, when 6 is rolled, the player is granted an extra
          roll, only 3 times of consecutive dice roll 6 is allowed, more than
          this will not grant an additional roll chance.
        </li>
        <li>
          “<em>crash plane</em> ”, when another colour chess has also stopped at
          a location where there is already a chess, this chess will be beaten
          and sent back to the hanger.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>stacking</strong> of same colour chess on the track. Stacking
          requires 2 or more chess in the same location. All these chesses of
          the stacked may move together, as the dice roll divided by the number
          of stacks. For example, in the stack of 3, a dice roll of 6 will use 6
          to divide 3, as result to move 2 steps by stacked chess. If the dice
          is rolled 5, the stack will move 1 step, and one of the chesses in the
          stack to move 2 more steps, breaking the stacks into 2, and 1 chess to
          move ahead.
        </li>
        <img
          src="./img/Chess Stacking and goal.JPG"
          alt="Chess stacking and goal zone"
        />
        <li>
          More <strong>stacking</strong>, when one colour chess tries to pass
          the stacks of other colours, the stacks will prevent them from doing
          so, forcing them to stop behind the stacks. Only the shortcut can pass
          the stacks, not even jumping is allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>stacking</strong> will prevent other colour chess to stop on
          them, which means the stack can not crash by other colour's chesses
          unless by another stacking of the same size or more.
        </li>
        <li>
          shortcut track, each colour has a shortcut track, the chess must stop
          exactly at the shortcut point to use the shortcut, jumping from the
          previous colour to this point will not trigger the shortcut path.
        </li>
        <li>
          shortcut tracks, this dotted track is on top space in the goal zone,
          if there is a chess stop at this location, crossing the shortcut will
          crash this chess piece in the goal zone, it will send back to the
          hanger
        </li>
        <img src="./img/Shortcut.JPG" alt="Shortcut path" />
        <li>
          Goal zone, the chess must land exactly at the destination to conclude
          that chess piece, otherwise, any extra step will lead the chess to go
          backward. This will require the next dice roll to attempt again.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Tips & Strategies:</h3>
      <ul class="red">
        <li>
          after rolling a 6, think about the landing location, if there are
          still chesses in the hanger, let them out to the start location first,
          as this spot can not be stepped on by other chess, which will not be a
          crash.
        </li>
        <li>beware of the chess behind, it may crash your chess piece.</li>
        <li>
          Stacking 2 chess is the most reasonable strategy, in this case, when
          an odd number is rolled, consider letting other chess pieces move
          instead of the stack. (odd number will break the stacks of 2)
        </li>
        <li>
          try not to stop on the shortcut track unless it is certainly safe to
          do so.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remember, there is a total of 4 chesses that can be moved on track,
          think about which one can trigger the jump or shortcut, and which one
          can be more benefits by the moves.
